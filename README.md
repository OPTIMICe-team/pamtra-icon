# pamtra-icon
Set of routines and libraries to run pamtra over ICON meteogram output

Since it is based on pamtra it is gonna work on python2 only! (For now)

The main file is run_pamtra.py, run
```
  python run_pamtra.py -h
```
for a list of the available options

The other files contain libraries of options that enable the user to deal with different ICON or measurement settings
